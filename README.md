# First-Attempt

I have gathered previously separate repostories under this repostory to eliminate clutter.

It contains my work notes and projects from the first year after I started working in these areas.

They are grouped into the following topics:

# DataAnalysis-wPython:

This folder contains study notes and sample projects on how to do data analysis with Python. In the Data Analaysis Study Notebooks folder, you will find comprehensive information about Numpy and Pandas in my lecture notes, links, and notebooks. You will find topics such as working with Numpy arrays, concat, split, indexing, selection, working with Pandas DataFrames, loc, iloc, multi selection and indexing, GroupBy and other useful operations, handling missing values, working with text and time data, difference and similarity of NaN & None, RegEx.
In the 'Data Analysis Projects' folder you will find sample reinforcement projects related to the above topics as well as extensive EDA work and projects using Seaborn - Matplotlib.
